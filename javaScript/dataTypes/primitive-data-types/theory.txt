Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They represent single values and are immutable and stored by value.

Types of Primitive Data Types:

String – represents textual data
Example: let name = "Alice";

Number – represents numeric values
Example: let age = 25;

Boolean – represents true or false
Example: let isOnline = true;

Undefined – a variable that is declared but not assigned a value
Example: let a;

Null – represents the intentional absence of any object value
Example: let b = null;

BigInt – used for integers larger than the safe integer limit
Example: let big = 12345678901234567890n;

Symbol – used to create unique identifiers
Example: let sym = Symbol("id");
