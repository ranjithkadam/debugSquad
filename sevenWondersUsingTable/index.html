                    ivory-white marble
                    mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned
                    in 1631 by
                    the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.‚Äâ1628‚Äì1658), to house the tomb of
                    his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the
                    centrepiece of a
                    17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal
                    gardens bounded on
                    three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the
                    historical
                    northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic
                    groups from
                    the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the
                    Qin
                    dynasty.[4][5] Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by
                    the Ming
                    dynasty (1368‚Äì1644).</p>

                    (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [Ààk…æistu  Åed·∫ΩÀàto Å]) is an Art
                    Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and
                    built by
                    Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot.
                    Romanian sculptor
                    Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98
                    ft) high,
                    excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of
                    reinforced
                    concrete and soapstone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)"
                        target="_blank">Christ the Redeemer</a> differs considerably from its original design, as the
                    initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the
                    project
                    organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms
                    spread out
                    wide.</p>

                    amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
                    Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is the
                    largest
                    standing amphitheatre in the world. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r.‚Äâ69‚Äì79 AD) in
                    72 and
                    was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r.‚Äâ79‚Äì81). Further modifications were
                    made during
                    the reign of Domitian (r.‚Äâ81‚Äì96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as
                    the Flavian
                    dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium;
                    Italian:
                    Anfiteatro Flavio [a…±fiteÀàaÀêtro ÀàflaÀêvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its
                    association with
                    their family name (Flavius).
