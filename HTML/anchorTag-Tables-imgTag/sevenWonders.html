        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal" target="_blank">Taj Mahal</a> is an ivory-white marble
        mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by
        the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658), to house the tomb of
        his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
        17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on
        three sides by a crenellated wall.

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China" target="_blank">Great Wall of China</a>
        (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally
        "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the historical
        northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from
        the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin
        dynasty.[4][5] Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming
        dynasty (1368–1644).</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra" target="_blank">Perta</a> (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized:
        Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα "Rock"), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or
        𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō),[3][4] is an ancient city and archaeological
        site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called
        the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7
        Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)" target="_blank">Christ the Redeemer</a>
        (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art
        Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by
        Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor
        Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high,
        excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced
        concrete and soapstone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)"
            target="_blank">Christ the Redeemer</a> differs considerably from its original design, as the
        initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project
        organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out
        wide.</p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum" target="_blank">Colosseum</a> is an elliptical
        amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
        Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is the largest
        standing amphitheatre in the world. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and
        was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during
        the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian
        dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian:
        Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with
        their family name (Flavius).
